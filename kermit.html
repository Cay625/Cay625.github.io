                    <h1>Frog Here</h1>
                    <p>Kermit the frog, originally appearing in 1955 show "Sam and Friends", is one of the most well known frogs in the entire world.<br>Kermit has a great personality that was able to land him a job as a news reporter on Seasame Street. He then went on to become so famous that he had an imposter version of himself frame him as an evil frog named Constantine. Kermit went to jail but being so awesome and cool he got out. So moral of the story,<br><strong>K e r m i t.</strong><br><br>I know there's more to Kermits story but I don't think it would all fit on this page and also I've never actually watched a muppets movie so I don't want to do him injustice.</p>
